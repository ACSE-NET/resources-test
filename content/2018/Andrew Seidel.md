## Title

Gradeless in ICS

## Abstract

In our board (Peel District School Board), there has been a focus on Overarching Learning Goals (OLGs), as well as a focus on Learning Goals and Success Criteria (as in Growing Success). With this foundation set in place last year, I have gone ahead and moved into the world of gradeless teaching. The focus of the course is on a growth mindset rather than a test-and-forget style of teaching, where students are encouraged to go back and fix their mistakes on previous assignments - continuously. As a by-product, this has lowered my marking load as well as having more meaningful in-depth conversations and observations of student work, allowing for more engaged learners. Are you also looking to get rid of your tests, quizzes, and exams, come join the conversation!
