## Title

Data Visualization

## Abstract

In-game data collection in sports has increased by leaps and bounds in recent years with the inclusion of camera data and wearable technology. This data is quite often publicly available and can be utilized in the classroom for the purpose of introducing students to various computational thinking concepts. Data visualization is an example of one of these concepts that resonates with students as both a tool for analysis and communication. In this interactive session, participants will be provided with a variety of data sets from various sports and will be guided through Python code examples to create visualizations from this data. This session will include an introduction to graphical entities and attributes and how each can be used effectively within a visualization. Furthermore, participants will be exposed to examples of using visualization in both sports and in the classroom. Finally, the participants will have an opportunity to take data sets, code snippets and lesson plan ideas back to their classroom for implementation.
