## Title

Advanced CS Concepts: Describing Artichoke Spirals and Count

## Abstract

The Fibonacci sequence of numbers is famous for its mathematical properties and occurrence in nature. How can we calculate the nth Fibonacci number and why might this be important? In this session, we will explore algorithms for determining a particular Fibonacci number. Although coding examples will be in Python, no prior knowledge is required. Ideas for exploring this topic and its real-world applications in a high school computer science classroom will also be presented and discussed.
