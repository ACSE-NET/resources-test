## Title

How Computers Work - code.org

## Abstract

In January 2018, Code.org released a 6 episode You Tube series called "How Computers Work".  This was part of their free educational information for the masses.  I have written a series of questions on each of the episodes, that your students can use to learn this information.  Furthermore, I have also included a solution set for you to use if you wish.  The Student question sheet is in RTF format, so you can edit it if you wish.  The Solution's are also in RTF format if you wish to edit them.  Enjoy.
