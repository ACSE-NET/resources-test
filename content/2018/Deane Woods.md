## Title

Motor Control Activity

## Abstract

This activity will allow your students to build and (hopefully) understand how a simple bi-directional motor control circuit works. Depending on the level of the students, you can give this as a “cookbook” exercise - providing them the complete circuit diagrams and photos of the circuit, or you can just provide the pinout diagram for the motor control chip and allow them to figure out how to build it.
