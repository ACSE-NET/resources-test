## Title

Deciding when it is better to fade away

## Abstract

The purpose of this resource is to:
Reinforce concepts (use of LEDs. resistors, a breadboard, and Arduino software) learned previously when building and programming a “blink” circuit. As this is a common and well-established launching point for introducing Arduino hardware and software, I have not included it in this resource. 
Construction of an electronic circuit that uses a digital pulse width modulation (PMW) pin on the microcontroller
Writing a program (the “fade” program) that contains an “if” statement for the circuit
Using experimentation to understand the logic of the “fade” program
