## Title

Swift Intro and end of Unit Review

## Abstract

This year my ICS4U learned both Java (Windows) and Swift (iOS and various emulators) and XCode.  At the end of the year we produced a game for Family Pastimes, matching the rules and concepts of a traditional board game they own.  The class produced an Android and an XCode version of the game.
The first lesson was setting up Swift/XCode on various emulators and experimenting with CodeAnywhere and Swift for Windows and RepelIt.
