## Title

Exploring the Wonders of Working with Motors for FREE

## Abstract

Most computer science teachers are not comfortable working with electronics, in particular with motors, principally due to lack of knowledge, experience or funds. They do not realize that they depriving their classes of all the experience, fun and excitement imaginable with electronics/motors. Hopefully this workshop would change that. 
In the first part of the workshop, teachers shall enjoy a hands-on treasure hunt for motors in junk computers (plenty of them around in school). Teachers shall capture at least 2 motors from them (FREE) to be experimented in this workshop. Motor types, principles and controls would then be outlined before we make circuits using Arduinos to run them.
