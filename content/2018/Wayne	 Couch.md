## Abstract

This resource is suitable as a major assignment for a unit related to DC electrical circuit theory including use of bread boards.   It could be used in any Grade 9 or 10 computer technology course. 
The assignment is completed in groups of two, but each group member must complete their own design work and be able to demonstrate their understanding of electrical circuits.
To prepare for this assignment students have learned basic electrical theory and practised creating simple LED circuits using bread boards.
