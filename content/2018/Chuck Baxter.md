## Title

Don’t Panic… Python?

## Abstract

Many of us got a lot of use out of Graham Smyth and Chris Stephenson’s workbooks on Turing and Java.  With the books having gone out of print, and a sunset on the Turing language, I have adapted some of the chapters to Python 2 (using Pygame for graphics) with Chris’s permission.  Their examples and assignment problems work well for the most part, and I have added others where they don’t.
Chapter 4 – Output
Chapter 5 – Input
Chapter 6 – Repetition
Chapter 7 – Selection
