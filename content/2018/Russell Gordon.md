## Title

Engaging Beginning Programmers with Visual Problem Solving

## Abstract

Producing on-screen graphics can make introductory programming more approachable and engaging for a broader range of beginning programmers. In this hands-on session, we will discuss and complete a progression of activities that focus on, initially, reproduction of existing images, and later, on production of original designs. Examples we will explore include, but are not limited to: reproducing gig posters, geometric patterns found in fashion, and pleating systems from architecture and product design. This is a language-agnostic session: most commonly used languages include graphics libraries that make drawing primitive shapes on a Cartesian plane straightforward. You will leave with materials for a complete unit of study and the building blocks for, potentially, an entire introductory programming course built around visual problem solving.
