## Title

TEJ20/3M Culminating Activities

## Abstract

This can be part or all of a grade 10 or 11 TEJ course culminating activity. It uses open-roberta which is a LEGO ev3 / NXT online simulation website that I have found useful when working with split classes, or other time or resource-limited situations.
Part I Is a simple networking exercise - change or add on as required.
Part II Uses Open-Roberta to challenge students' understanding of robotics / robotics programming.
Part III Is an Arduino/Genuino build assignment that challenges students digital design / programming skill with Arduino kits
