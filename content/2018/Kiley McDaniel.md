## Title

Python and Turtle

## Abstract

Turtle in Python gives students an opportunity to learn programming concepts in an entertaining way.   It gives them a break from the traditional problem sets and appeals to visual learners.   This resource works well with ICS2O and ICS3C classes.   The "Test pygame.py" file can be run once you have installed Pygame and will confirm if the install worked.   Pygame will enable students to create simple GUI games and supports multimedia.   Students who are progressing well in Python may want to use Pygame for a culminating task.
