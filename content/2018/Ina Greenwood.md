## Title

What do your students know? Diagnostic Quiz

## Abstract

Since grades 10 and 11 ICS courses have no pre-requisite, it is worth the effort to get a handle on the level of knowledge your students bring to the course. This simple diagnostic is not onerous for the students to complete. While many of the terms are mentioned or implied in the curriculum documents, some simple everyday terms/concepts are included so students feel some level of proficiency and arenâ€™t frightened away from the course. Of course teachers will add or delete and group terms as appropriate for their program.
