## Title

Binary Tree

## Abstract

 This resource can be used for the introduction to binary trees for ICS4U1 class.  It teaches students the concept of binary trees, binary search trees and how to construct the binary tree using diagrams. Based on a given binary tree, students also learn how to list all nodes by applying preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal by using recursive algorithm. Practices including the knowledge understanding and application implementation are also provided for assessment purposes, as well as the answer and sample code. (Students need to have some prior knowledge of linked list)
