## Title

Ergonomics 101 - Workstation 101

## Abstract

The following are links to presentations I put together that discuss ergonomics in the classroom and stretching exercises. Good practices around computers can mitigate the aggravation of repetitive strain injuries common to people who use computers and other devices regularly in their professional and personal lives.  The resources are not all-encompassing, are referenced from other resources found/used, but will give a good start to beginning users around appropriate tech use.
