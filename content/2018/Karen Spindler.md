## Title

Subway Assignment for ICS3U

## Abstract

This resource is a summative assessment for the ICS3U course for the "Programming Concepts & Skills" strand. It requires students to demonstrate their understanding of number systems (binary, decimal, hexadecimal), math operators, string manipulation, methods, random number generation, and arrays. Students are asked to create 2 programs: a NumberConversion program that converts between different number systems, and a BirthdayParadox program that asks students to simulate a famous probability question. The rubric, coded with the curriculum expectations, is included. I have also included a lesson (from a previous unit in my course outline) that teaches about the converting between number systems. This lesson was modified from a resource in the OERB. The resource is in HTML format, and the language used is Java (easily adapted to other languages).
