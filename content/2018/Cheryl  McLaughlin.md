## Title

BlueJ Pelican textbook Resource

## Abstract

This is a power point presentation that goes with the BlueJ Pelican Textbook.  It covers the first ten lessons.
The link to the textbook is:  
https://www.lingleville.us/cms/lib/TX01001121/Centricity/Domain/26/BPJ_TextBook_3_0_5.pdf
I typically use a portion of the textbook.  I will work through portions of the textbook.  There are a few references within the textbook that may need to be skipped.  
I have included my first ten lessons on both a power point with .pptx  and also .ppt.
I am in the process of re-doing some quizzes with this resource.
