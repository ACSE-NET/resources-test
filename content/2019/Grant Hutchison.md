## Title

Scenario based Java Programming

## Abstract

In this session we will explore all aspects of Java object-oriented design and programming including: polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, and composition using new features of Java including  JavaFX for graphics (with and without Scene Builder). 

We will explore student activities and assignments including how to guide student understanding using Peer Instruction (PI), worked examples, code sketching, and sub-goal labeling. We will also examine some ideas for integrating performance based evaluations and single-point rubrics. Project management and source code management will also be included in the workshop.

This session is primarily targeting the Grade 12 - ICS4U curriculum expectations and we will be using Eclipse as our IDE throughout the workshop.
