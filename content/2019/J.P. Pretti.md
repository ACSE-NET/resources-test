## Title

Thinking Efficiently

## Abstract

Modern languages like Python give us invaluable tools and immense power. While this is fantastic, it means we run the risk of using too much to solve relatively simple problems. We will explore this idea by considering the efficiency of different algorithms to solve the same problem. Our goal will be to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to “think efficiently” when solving a problem using Python
