## Title

Swift CCC

## Abstract

I know a lot of us who teach CS love the CCC (Canadian Computing Competition). Waterloo has done, and continue to do, a great job in creating these fun and interactive  CS challenges. However, the CCC doesn’t support all languages and as some of you know, there are many new and upcoming exciting languages taking over in popularity. I took upon myself to translate a few of the CCC into the Swift programming language. Included in the zip file, you will find 20 playground files covering 10 past CCC. I have included a challenge playground file (which only houses the question and the .in files – can be given to students as an assignment or test) along side 10 playgrounds providing the solutions. Hope you enjoy!
