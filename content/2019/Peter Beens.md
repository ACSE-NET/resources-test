## Title

Turtle Graphics using Python

## Abstract

This presentation is an introduction to Turtle Graphics using Python. Also included is a cheatsheet with introductory Turtle Graphics commands. 

It is a tutorial Chad Whittington and I presented at the 2018 OSSTF "Embracing Technology Conference", created as part of a DSBN (District School Board of Niagara) learning team initiative where we developed PD resources to share with other teachers.

The documents are included in PowerPoint and Excel format but I am also including the URL of the original Google documents below.
