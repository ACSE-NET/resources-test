## Title

Beginning Python

## Abstract

Session provides a hands-on introduction to Python language with two on-line learning sites: CS Circles (Waterloo) followed by Snakify.org.  Participants will create accounts and be guided through the opening lessons. Fundamental programming concepts will be highlighted with analogies and demonstrations that can be duplicated in the classroom. No previous experience in Python is required.  Upon completion of the session, participants will readily be able to further develop their Python skills by continuing on-line lessons at their own pace
