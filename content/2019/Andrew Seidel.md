## Title

ICS4U - Give them a Choice

## Abstract

Students in Grade 12 are planning to head out into the world and will need to get a good foundation for what happens after academia.  The focus of the grade 12 course is to allow students to grow as individuals while giving each of them choice in what project they are working on, what language they are using, and where to guide their own learning.  Come join in a meaningful discussion on how to liberate your students, and hear about my experience allowing the students to choose their own project and how to manage many languages in one class. This could prove useful for those teaching split classes (or are expecting to) going forward.  Come join the conversation!
