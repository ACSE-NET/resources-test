## Title

Engineering Projects: Robots for Students in Grades 5-10

## Abstract

Participants will be building a Robot using an Arduino board, Aluminum chassis, DC motors, LEDs, a piezo buzzer and use an online platform to assemble and learn the programming of the robot. This workshop is ideal for teachers of Grade 5 to 10. The challenge is to use these basic parts and build a robot that can perform a dance routine while playing music and lighting up LEDs. There are thousands of ways to build this robot. The curriculum covers all aspects of STEAM. 
 
This project can be run as a class project, an after-school activity or run as a competition.  The curriculum to build and program the robot is completely laid out on the interactive platform so participants would need to bring a computer.
