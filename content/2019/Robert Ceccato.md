## Title

Dealing with Split Classes

## Abstract

With the change in government and the mandated class size increase, many teachers are now in the situation where they are teaching a split class to keep their courses alive.  So this begs the question, how do I teach a split class?  In this session we are going to focus on strategies and best practices that can be used to teach the ICS 3U and 4U split course.  We are going to look at the expectations in both courses and come together to find a way to integrate both of these creatures into one functional class, while trying to maintain our sanity!  Bring your ideas or your interest and my goal by the end of the session will be for you to walk away with a good idea of how you can do this in an efficient and effective manner.  As an aside, I have never taught a split course before, so this session will rely heavily on the feedback that I have received from teachers who have taught split courses in the past.
