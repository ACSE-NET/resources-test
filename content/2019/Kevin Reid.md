## Title

OmniChair Project

## Abstract

Two of my senior students wanted to create a project for a local robotics competition - open in nature about the requirements for entering. They chose to create an omnidirectional wheelchair. I have included their submission to the contest and I have included what I think would be most useful for other teachers, an interface guide to join an Arduino and Raspberry Pi. This guide includes information to start from scratch and join these two boards and use programming to control devices
