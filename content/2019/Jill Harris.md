## Title

Binary/Octal/Hex for TEJ3MI

## Abstract

This is a TEJ3MI 2 lessons on Binary/Octal/Hex at the beginning of the unit.  The documentation refers to where you are going in the following lessons, but they are not included.  The first lesson is very basic, power point, some examples on the board and worksheets.  Pretty boring, but the next day is a room, area of school hunt.  This everyone has fun with.  Prepare early and get teachers permission to visit their class rooms.  If your school is a maze of cubby holes, students by grade 11 still don't know where everything is.  Send ESL and ELD students to ESL teacher's first, students with IEP's to resources first and student success etc.  I tend to do this in pairs.  I've included my sheets, but you will need to change room numbers to fit your school.  (Don't forget VP's and Guidance, support staff too.)  Note:  I send the teacher's their room number so they may check - some do some don't.
