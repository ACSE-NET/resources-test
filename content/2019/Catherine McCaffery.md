## Title

Under 40 - Dice Game

## Abstract

Game was designed with the Gr 11 ICS 3U/C class in mind and is scaffolded to both demonstrate various programming skills (decisions, loops, methods etc) and encourage the breakdown of a problem into various smaller and manageable pieces (ICS 3C class does not complete the arrays section)
Coding can be done independently or started independently and then integrated with partners/groups at the methods stage by using the designs and ideas of multiple people
There is a checklist included for both student/teacher use if desired
