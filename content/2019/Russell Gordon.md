## Title

Designing ICS2O to Attract More Students

## Abstract

“Young women are one half of our available pool of students; in this session I share materials and my educated guesses about what has driven continued enrolment in ICS2O, and re-enrolment of young women in ICS3U."

For the first time in my teaching career, enrolment of young women in ICS3U for the coming school year outnumbers young men (at last check, 8 girls and 7 boys). More than that, 4 of the 8 girls enrolling in ICS3U just completed ICS2O with me. Enrolment in ICS2O is also healthy again (projection for 18 students at last check). This is at a school with a total population of 350 students in grades 9 through 12. With few other variables, I’m left to (cautiously) conclude that some deliberate changes in what I emphasized in ICS2O has kept the interest of young men, and grown the interest of young women at my school. In this session, I will share resources and advocate for an approach to computer studies that reflects the reality of skills required in the industry.
