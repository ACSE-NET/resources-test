## Title

Grade 9 Mathematics/Coding in Artificial Intelligence

## Abstract

The outcry for Coding in education from educators/administrators at all levels has been going for a long time. Unfortunately little fruitful outcomes, if any, materialize, principally due to lack of technical know-hows, endeavours and supporting resources.  The goal of this workshop is to demonstrate coding works well together with mathematics in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the hottest stream in current technological development. Surprisingly simple, coding in elementary AI is nothing more than seeing the whole Grade 9 Mathematic Curriculum in action. 

Hopefully this presentation could convince teachers that there are rationale, room, and benefits for coding in the classroom in all disciplines, and reasons to change our traditional ways of teaching in face of advancing technology, so that we as teachers could prepare, orient and equip our students better to meet the challenges they are facing in todayâ€™s digital age. This would be a great opportunity for teachers to discuss, reflect and exchange ideas on the issue. Coding implementations of basic AI principles in Java as well as Python, such as colors detection, shapes recognition and distortions corrections are explained and demonstrated. Practical and easy applications are recommended for introductory computer engineering, computer programming and even cross-curriculum courses with no prerequisites and for everyone!
