## Title

ICS3U Guess Who Conditions Assignment

## Abstract

In my ICS3U course, I introduce the following concepts in this order:  variables and use of variables, conditions and then loops.

One of the challenges was to have an assignment on conditions, but without the knowledge of how to loop something.  The assignment I created is a "one-way" Guess Who game where the user selects a certain character from a "board", and the program proceeds to ask the user questions until it pinpoints exactly who the character is.  The initial goal is to be 100% correct, but for the more advanced students, I discuss factors such as a balanced decision tree in order to ask the minimum number of questions regardless of who the user picks.

This also is the beginning of emphasizing the importance of planning out your program before coding.  The students are asked to come out with a dichotomous key to their solution.  Ideally, I would have loved to combine this assignment with a grade 11 Biology assignment our school does with Dichotomous keys, but I discovered that the one they come up with in Biology is not very extensive.

Since I use C in ICS3U, the students get a good experience dealing with squiggly brackets {} in terms of matching them up.  I also emphasize the importance of indentation, and nested indentation as the conditions gets more nested for code readability.

I started off this assignment with a few "boards" the students can choose from, but over the years, students have found online that I have permitted them to use as well.  I have included all the boards that I have collected.

I have also included a marking rubric for the assignment.
