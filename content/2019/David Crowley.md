## Title

VPython for Physics Students

## Abstract

#Background
I am a converted physics and science teacher. This year I will be teaching my first computer science and robotics courses. The resource I am sharing is one that I found when trying to implement some elements of coding into my SPH3U physics classes. It is authored by Rhett Allain, a physics professor at Southeastern Louisiana University, a popular columnist at Wired.com (often doing video analysis of movies to test the physics) and a consultant for the new McGyver TV series.
#Coding resources
The code uses a modified version of Python called VPython that makes 3D modeling fairly straightforward. It can be run locally, but is often used entirely online (see: Glowscript.org or Trinket.io). All the links in Mr. Allain's public resource are for Trinket.io.
#Teaching methodology
Since the resource is geared towards physics students and teachers, it is based on editable code and starter code. Students are then asked a variety of physics-related questions that make them engage with the code in increasingly more complex and complete ways. The goal is both a better physics understanding and a better grasp of basic coding ideas (such as declaring variables, arrays [VPython has a special array of size 3 called vec that is used for
3-dimensional vectors], loops, vector and scalar arithmetic, displaying results, real time
interactivity).
