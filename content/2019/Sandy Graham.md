## Title

How Data is Represented in a Computer

## Abstract

This session will cover some of the details of how data is represented in a computer. In particular, we will find out why doing calculations with floating point numbers can cause surprising results in higher-level languages and why in some languages if you add two large positive integers you get a negative number result. We will explore some of the different ways a sequence of bits can be interpreted.
