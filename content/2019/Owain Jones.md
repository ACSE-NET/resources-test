## Title

Logic Lab (Boolean Challenges)

## Abstract

This is a set of logic challenges using a website called Logic Lab. These problems can be used to reinforce boolean logic, students can also demonstrate different representations of logic (e.g. Truth Tables) They can also use boolean algebra to simplify the circuits. Eventually they can incorporate flip-flops into their work.  The problems increase in difficulty.
