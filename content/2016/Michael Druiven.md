## Title

Ardunio and the Internet of Things

## Abstract

This session will focus on using WiFi enabled microcontrollers in the classroom. The Arduino Yun will be introduced. Participants should bring their laptop with the latest Arduino IDE downloaded from http://arduino.cc. We will discuss the "Internet of Things" and the exciting possibilities for young imaginative entrepreneurs. We will use the Yun to collect data in the lab and post it to a Google Spreadsheet. Participants will need to create an account on Temboo.com.
