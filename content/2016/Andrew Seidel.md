## Title

Integrating the Genius Hour into the ICS4U Curriculum

## Abstract

Genius Hour, also known as Google 20%, has always been something that I’ve wanted to try in the classroom.  After four successful test-driven semesters of implementing it in my ICS4U classroom, I believe it’s time to share my experiences!  Students are given the freedom to learn whatever they want in the classroom, as long as it is related to computer studies.  This is rarely a freedom given to the student, especially in a Grade 12 classroom, as we always have so much curriculum to get through.  Luckily, the ICS4U curriculum allows for this – the Project Management strand.  Come ready to share, learn, gather resources, and brainstorm other ideas for your classroom – providing freedom to the students to work on projects they want to work on!
