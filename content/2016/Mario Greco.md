## Title

HTML & CSS Test

## Abstract

This is a test I created, based on the first three modules of Khan Academy’s Web Development program. I used it for my BBT1O class, however you may use it for any class, if you choose to deliver an intro to web development unit. Included is the test itself, its answer sheet, and a “jotted point” list of all content found in the first three modules of Khan Academy’s web development program. Some of the “incorrect answers” of the multiple choice questions include my own quirky interests, so you may change them according to your own tastes as you see fit. In addition, the Khan Academy website can be found at this link: https://www.khanacademy.org/. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me at mgreco157@gmail.com. Cheers!
