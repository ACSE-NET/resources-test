## Title

Preparing for AP CS Principles

## Abstract

The new Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles course introduces students to the key ideas of computer science. The course develops the students' computational thinking practices as they explore seven (7) big ideas (Creativity, Abstraction, Data and Information, Algorithms, Programming, The Internet, Global Impact). Unlike the existing AP CS A course, which is an excellent object-oriented Java course focusing on algorithms and data structures, AP CS Principles can be taught using any programming language. The course involves performance tasks (coding and writing) and an exam. 
In this session we will examine how the AP CS Principles framework can be mapped to the Grade 11 Computer Science (ICS3U) curriculum. The course syllabus and outline that we will explore will use App Inventor and Python to accomplish the programming and algorithm requirements of the course.
