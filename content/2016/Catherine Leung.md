## Title

p5.js â€“ Processing in JavaScript

## Abstract

p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible to artists, designers, educators, and beginners and reinterprets this for today's web". Essentially it is what Processing would have been, if it had been based in JavaScript and HTML5 instead of Java. p5.js will let you draw with the ease of Processing but work with all the features of the modern web. If you know Processing, you will find a good deal of similarities between it and p5.js.  However, p5.js works in the browser and you are writing using just html/css/JavaSript, making this a very easy technology to access in the classroom. All you need is a modern web browser and text editor.  This session will guide you through the basics of p5.js and allow you to create interesting graphical projects with your students.
