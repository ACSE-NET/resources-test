## Title

 ESD and Safety

## Abstract

I used this lesson in the middle of a unit on computer hardware, after the students completed theory assignments and just before they were about to open old computers and do hands-on assignments. This lesson and assignment should take approximately 1 period with some homework or perhaps 1.5 periods without homework
