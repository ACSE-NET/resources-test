## Title

Beat That Dice Game

## Abstract

This resource is suitable as a major assignment in an introductory programming class such as Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Science (ICS2O). This particular example was used as a final programming assignment in ICS2O. The assignment is written based on the solution being completed using Python but it could be completed with other languages. This program could be made more complex and suitable for higher level courses by increasing the number of dice and therefore requiring more involved sorting.  A marking has also been provided.
