## Title

Reading Code

## Abstract

This is an assignment best done in groups of 4. It allows them to help each other out and also see how others work through code. The purpose is to emphasize reading, understanding, commenting and testing code. The six other documents are the programs for each group to use. This allows groups to help each other without doing the exact same work.
