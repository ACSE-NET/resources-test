## Title

Computer Engineering Technology Safety Tips and OCTE Safety 

## Abstract

In this single session, participants will have a chance to view, explore and review the OCTE Safety documents that are accessible to all Computer Engineering teachers through the OCTE Website.  We will also discuss the rationale, and reasoning behind the creation of these documents and we will also look at the liability of teaching a Computer Engineering course.
