## Title

McBain’s Maze Adventure – Programming in Java using NetBeans

## Abstract

In this assignment, students create a themed “maze” where a user can navigate through several panels by clicking on directional buttons. As the user navigates the maze, they will pick up objects. An inventory of items is displayed in the bottom panel of the GUI. As more items are collected, users will be able to enter into new parts of the maze. The goal of the game is to collect all needed items and end on a specific panel. This assignment was given after students were familiar with creating basic GUIs in Java using NetBeans 7.4. Students were able to add labels, add buttons and import and insert images into both using the icon property. Students were also familiar with decision structures and animations. Students were required to include decision structures in this assignment, and were encouraged to use animation if they felt comfortable. Included in the Resources are a short lesson giving some specific directions regarding the assignment, a map of McBain’s Maze and zipped sample NetBeans project McBain’s Maze, and a pdf copy of the java code.
