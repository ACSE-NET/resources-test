## Title

Binary Numbers

## Abstract

The resource introduces the concept of binary numbers to students and relates it to computer hardware.  It reviews the similarities to the decimal number system and also talks further about binary is directly linked to on/off switches as computer hardware.
There is an activity attached that allows the students to convert a binary sequence and then the decimal result  will map to a letter that answers the question on the side.
