## Title

Information Literacy Skills

## Abstract

The Mobile Information Literacy (MIL) Project, developed at Renison University College, is a mobile technology, user friendly, and open access
literacy interface available for use to course instructors and undergraduate students. The objectives of the project are to develop strategies for enhancing student information literacy skills through mobile technology (mlearning). This innovative project will support the development and administration of the use of the MIL Tool and will explore the best strategies, from a user perspective, for delivering and accessing
information on mobile devices. We anticipate that higher education communities will benefit from students’ enhanced abilities in accessing web-based information to complete academic assignments and research projects.
