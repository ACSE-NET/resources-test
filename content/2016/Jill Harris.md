## Title

Vocabulary for Java

## Abstract

For the past two years I’ve been working with ELD and ESL students.  I’ve learned just how important words and vocabulary are and ASSUME NOTHING!  (You never know where the gaps are, small and large.)
With a literacy focus, here are a series of word/vocabulary lessons that I have used at the beginning of some units and at the end again or sometimes just when needed.  Some make great exit tickets too.  
Each one can be a whole lesson (can sometimes be two with ELD or one with ESL), but typically are part of a lesson and work well clarifying language and terms.  They are written with Java in mine, but can easily be changed and modified as needed.
I hope you have fun with these and find them useful.  They’ve been springboards for crosswords and word searches too.
