## Title

ICS3UE Moodle Course

## Abstract

This is a backup of my Moodle Course for ICS3UE.  It is meant to be a self-directed course for students, reducing lecture time.  It is based on the open course 
http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html 
and uses CS Circles.  The VPL plugin is used for several autograded quizzes and assignments.  There is included a small bank of multiple choice questions, and references to practice questions from past CCC's on the autograder dmoj.
