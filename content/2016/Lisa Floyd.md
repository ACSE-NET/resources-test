## Title

Strategies for Implementing CS in Elementary Schools

## Abstract

Many of us are aware of the excitement students feel when theyâ€™re introduced to computer science in grades 10 and 11.  Coding tools are now allowing students to become familiar with and understand advanced computer science concepts at a much younger age.  Some Faculties of Education have even started teaching Computational Thinking Courses for all students in Bachelor of Education programs.  Exposing students to Computer Science concepts at younger ages may help to enhance understanding of math ideas, encourage more females to consider ICS at the high school level and also develop Computational Thinking and problem solving skills that can be applied to all subject areas.  Several suggested tools and tasks that have been facilitated with elementary school students and teachers will be shared.
