## Title

Cross Platform Vizwik for Apps Development

## Abstract

If you want Apps Development yourself or for your students, or if you think App Inventor and Scratch are great, you would not want to miss my Vizwik workshop. I am going to help you to use Vizwik to develop mobile apps painlessly, fast and fun. Vizwik is a visual coding platform for apps development. Forget about OS like Android, IOS or Windows. All you need is Chrome to work with Vizwik. Most important of all, the apps you developed would work for all devices! Vizwik was created by Simon Gauvin, a New Brunswick professor and designed to fit in the classroom environment. I could guarantee that you could confidently develop mobile games, maps utilities, videos/music broadcasts, or social networking in minutes after my hands-on exploratory session
