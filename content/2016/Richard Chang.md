## Title

E-Waste Reading Sheet

## Abstract

This is 1 page research activity where students use their devices or ay available computers to read articles and watch videos on Electronic Waste.  This can be a standalone assignment for those days when you are absent and you need a simple self-guided activity.  At the end of the activity a detailed discussion should take place.  The discussion can be done as a whole class, or possibly in small groups prior to discussing and sharing as a class.  If necessary, prompts can be given to the students to help direct the discussions.  
I am not the creator of this activity, nor do I know who is to give credit to them.
