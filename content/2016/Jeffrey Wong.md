## Title

Lightbot Worksheet

## Abstract

Lightbot is a flash game that introduces the concept of programming to students through controlling a robot. The game teaches students the the proper sequencing commands, functions, and loops. The game is available at https://lightbot.com/hocflash.html
I created the following worksheets provide the student a platform to record their solutions as well as some discussion questions on several programming topics. The students work through lightbot on their own use the sheet as a guide. The teacher reviews the worksheet with the class when the class is done. Time of activity varies from students but in general it takes about 45-60 minutes.
