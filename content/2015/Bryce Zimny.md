## Title

Encryption Assignment - String manipulation

## Abstract

This activity assesses String manipulation in Java. It requires the use of a caesar cypher (character substitution) with extensions to file I/O (encrypting files and output to files) as well as students deriving their own encryption schemes (tying in math concepts such as 1-1 functions).
