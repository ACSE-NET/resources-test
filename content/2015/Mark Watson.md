## Title

Hardware Component Assignment

## Abstract

It is a relatively simple computer hardware components assignment that can be used in the ICS2O and TEJ2O courses and, with some minor tweaks, possibly in the ICS3C and ICS 3U courses. Students go online to source parts to “build” a desktop computer within a budget and document their findings, including pictures, specs and prices. It is a good assignment to give when teacher is away, since it is easy to follow and generally interesting to students.
