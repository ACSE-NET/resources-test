## Title

Practical Tools to Support Accountable PBL in CS

## Abstract

Do you cringe at the thought of writing or using rubrics jam-packed with 9-point text crammed into a 20-cell table? Student voice and choice are key to project-based learning, but have you ever wondered how you could mark 30 different student products and retain your sanity? In this hands-on session, you will have extended time with two Canadian-made software tools (Sesame and Edusight) that directly support student voice and choice, reflection, and regular critique and refinement – several of the essential elements of project-based learning (PjBL), as defined by the Buck Institute for Education (http://bit.ly/1DGm5L4). I will share how I have used these tools to facilitate PjBL in my computer science classes, while also keeping track – with minimal effort – of what curriculum objectives my students have mastered. Please note that you will see actual student products, reflections, and teacher feedback. You will also have the opportunity to test-drive both Sesame and Edusight. This is a lab, not a lecture! Finally, these tools and how I am using them continues to evolve, and I look forward to a vigorous peer discussion about merits and drawbacks.
