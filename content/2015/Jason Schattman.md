## Title

 Cellular Automaton Assignment

## Abstract

In this week-long assignment, students code the classic automaton Conway's Game of Life and then design and code their own cellular automaton.  Students are provided with a template for getting started with coding Game of Life. 
As part of their own design, students must write a 1-page description of the real-life phenomenon that their automaton models (e.g. a predator-prey ecosystem) and the specific evolution rules of the automaton.
Several exemplar projects done by students in past semesters are also provided. 
Prerequisite knowledge:  functions & procedures, 2-D arrays, basic graphics and loop-based animations.  OOP is not required.
