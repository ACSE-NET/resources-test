## Title

Making Analysis of Algorithms and Data Structures Make Sense

## Abstract

Part of the curriculum in ISC4U is on analysis of algorithms and data structures.  This concept is highly mathematical and is difficult to grasp even for students in their second and third year in university, so how do you teach it to students in grade 12?  This workshop will provide  a refresher on algorithms and data structure as well as techniques to teach it to students at a high school level.
