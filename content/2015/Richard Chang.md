## Title

Ubuntu Installation

## Abstract

This worksheet is intended for a TEJ 2O0 curriculum.  I see this resource being used as a hands-on learning activity that can be a one day or two day exercise.  It is expected that students will have workstations that they may format and install on as necessary so School Board computers are not recommended.  Students may work in pairs depending on the number of available workstations.  Students can be self-directed with this worksheet with minimal teacher instruction. 
This worksheet is intended for students to become familiar with Operating Systems (OS).  It will help students learn how to install an OS onto a workstation, as well as the different types of OS and the differences between them.  It will also familiarize them with the command line interface.
