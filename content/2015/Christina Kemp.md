## Title

 Reality Show Application

## Abstract

This project is a multi-step assignment where students create a Contestant object to store user information, a Label object to format the Contestant information into a specific format, and a main class to receive the information and validate that the contestant is eligible. They will also be asked to create their own exceptions for incorrect input, and a graphical user interface for the project. Another option would be to have the students save the information to a txt file, and then restore the information to continue.
