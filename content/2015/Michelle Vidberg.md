## Title

Making Apps for Younger Students â€“ A Collaboration

## Abstract

The Waterloo Region District School Board piloted an "Apps4Learning" program this past year.  For the program, several senior Computer Science and Communications Technology classes were paired up with Grade 5/6 classes in their area.  The younger students generated ideas for educational apps and the older students created the apps.  Learn more about the program and consider whether you might try something similar in your own board.
