## Title

Black Box Testing

## Abstract

In both ICS 3U and 4U there are opportunities to have students do black box testing. The students are given the program specifications and then test an executable to determine if it can pass their test cases.  In this case, a trucking company charges to ship cans.  The program calculates the shipping charges based on the size of the can, how many cans and distance shipped. There are two test programs, one that mostly works apart from borderline cases and another one that should work but has more restrictions on range.  They are written in 'C' but shouldn't matter what language you are using.  This was also an opportunity to teach the basics of Microsoft Excel, which proved to be an unexpected gap in the students' learning.
