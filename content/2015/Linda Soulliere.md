## Title

Outreach to Students Before Grade 10

## Abstract

The Problem: A select few students consider taking computer science/engineering. Few students feel computer science/engineering is “for them”. However, computer science/engineering courses develop skills needed by all students to be successful in today’s work force. All students need to obtain skills in creative problem solving; teamwork; communication; project and time management, technical skills, etc.  So how do we encourage students who don’t see themselves in a computer science/engineering career to take courses in computer science/engineering to develop valuable skills no matter what their path may be?
