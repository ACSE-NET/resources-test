## Title

 Number Systems

## Abstract

This resource provides worksheets, review activities and tests for teaching number system conversions (Binary, Hexadecimal). Space is provided with each question for students to show their work (using place values to convert any number to decimal and using repeated division by the new base to convert decimal numbers to any base). The activity where they create their own number system helps them to understand that the process of conversion is the same for any number system.
