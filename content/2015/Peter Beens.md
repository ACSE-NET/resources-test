## Title

Learning Python with CS Circles, CEMC’s Amazing Online Tool 

## Abstract

In this double session, we will get an overview of one teacher’s success using CS Circles in the classroom to teach Python, outlining the reasons it is so successful, how it can be used to monitor students’ progress, and how its use has been augmented with additional programming challenges. Plenty of time will be left to play with CS Circles to learn Python if you are new to it or to reinforce more advanced concepts if you are experienced. Questions and lively dialogue will be encouraged!
