## Title

Coding and Makerspaces: Give My Students a Voice

## Abstract

In this session participants will explore the continuum of coding from doing so without technology to using coding tutorials, to using code to create content with tools like Scratch. Participants will learn about how coding supports elementary numeracy and enables students to take risks, fail safely, debug and think critically. Participants will leave with ideas of how to integrate coding to any elementary grade level classroom as well as lists of tools to explore and try in their classes.
