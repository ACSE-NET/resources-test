## Title

 The “PizzaNow” Learning Progression for Unit 4 of ICS3U

## Abstract

This implementation of Unit 4 uses a teen-friendly theme (the PizzaNow franchise) to provide mastery with (1) investigating and traversing a file system using terminal commands, (2) analysing, running and editing bash scripts to copy, move, modify and delete files and directories in a file system, (3) analysing, running and editing Python programs to copy, move, modify and delete files and directories in a file system. The vi editor is used to modify scripts and programs in Unit 4 (to add both breadth and depth to the ICS3U skill set). The students are passionate about the learning curves in Unit 4 because of their (age-appropriate) obsession with Pizza; a delicious and magical food that just shows up on your doorstep whenever you want. They love the challenge of Unit 4 and never get lost in a file system again.
