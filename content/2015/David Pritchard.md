## Title

Websheets: Creating Web-based Programming Exercises

## Abstract

This session will focus on a new online exercise system called Websheets, which allows you to create fill-in-the-blank exercises. We'll talk about different ways that auto-graded exercises can be used as part of a programming course, and advice on different techniques. During the lab we will create your own exercises; we will try solving them and give each other feedback. I will also briefly discuss related work on the most common error messages that occur when beginners are programming.
