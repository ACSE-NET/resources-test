## Title

Analog Clock

## Abstract

This resource contains a template for creating an analog clock app in C# with an ICS3U or 4U class. A completed program is also included as well as an assignment sheet with a rubric. 
The program allows students the opportunity to use the DateTime function as well as requires them to use trig to determine where to draw the various hands of the clock. Although this program has been written for C# is could easily be adapted for use with other programming languages.
Note that this program was created for a high DPI display and as such you may need to make minor alterations for it to look correct on low resolution screens.
