## Title

Collaboration, Genius and Project Management - The Softer Si

## Abstract

This talk will discuss some strategies and tools that have helped build collaboration and engagement. 
I will discuss the use of Google's Genius Hour in my classes to engage students and promote cross-curricular thinking. I will share a fun paper airplane exercise I use in my ICS4 classes to teach Project Management and collaboration in preparation for their final project. Finally, we'll look at tools to promote collaboration of code and thought.
