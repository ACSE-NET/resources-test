## Title

What to do in ISC4U?

## Abstract

The Grade 12 ICS4U curriculum can be daunting for new CS teachers. In this workshop, teachers will participate in discussions and activities that may help enrich their existing ICS4U offering using software engineering principles and techniques. The goal of the session is to exchange ideas and prepare our students for post-secondary studies that will involve the use of computational thinking skills.
The session will use Java and Eclipse as the primary language and IDE, but other languages will be considered based on topics being discussed.
 The session topics will include:
- discussion of Advanced Placement - AP Computer Science A and ICS4U 
- hands-on activity using relational database and design patterns
- discussion of algorithm analysis
- discussion of software design techniques - role of UML
- discussion of software testing techniques
- project management ( traditional and agile )
- discussion of role of web technologies, GUIs and mobile app development (Android)
- hands-on activities for cloud computing, analytics and big data topics
