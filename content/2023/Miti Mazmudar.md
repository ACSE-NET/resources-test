## Title

Exploring Network Security with Netsim

## Abstract

We'll explore using an online game, Netsim, to teach basics of computer networks and introduce students to different types of network security attacks. Netsim is designed as a network simulator and players craft packets with different fields to achieve the objectives of each level of the game. Netsim provides positive feedback on completing each level and as such, supports experiential or active learning --- players usually tweak fields until they get a success message for that level. 

In this workshop, I'll describe the game mechanics and participants will first briefly play the game. We'll then discuss sample introductory material for security concepts and attacks, which can be interleaved with game play. Participants will leave with a sample lesson plan, and a player's guide.

The game is available online at: https://netsim.erinn.io/
