## Title

OpenProcessing: A p5.js IDE and Course Management Tool

## Abstract

OpenProcessing is a web-based IDE for p5.js programming. The language allows students to easily create graphical output and manage mouse and keyboard input. In this session we will take a quick look at the p5.js language and then spend more time looking at the Professor Plus+ classroom platform. A Professor Plus+ license allows teachers to easily disseminate materials to students, provide feedback on the code they write, and submit assignments.
