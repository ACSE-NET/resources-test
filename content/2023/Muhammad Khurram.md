## Title

Visual Learning Tool for Programming

## Abstract

I have designed lessons for the beginners to learn the basic coding concepts visually using the Applab from Code.org
Applab is a feature of Code.org’s curriculum designed to help kids learn programming using JavaScript. Code.org is a non-profit organization that aims to make computer science education more accessible and engaging for students worldwide. It provides a simplified programming environment where students can create web applications and games using JavaScript programming languages. The interface is user-friendly and allows students to drag and drop blocks of code to build their applications, making it accessible for beginners and young learners. Following are the key features of the Applab are:
1.        Visual Programming: Applab uses a block-based coding, similar to scratch, where students can snap together blocks of codes to create their programs. The visual representation makes it easier for kids to understand the logic and flow of their code.
2.        JavaScript Fundamentals: Although Applab offers visual coding interface, it exposes students to the fundamentals of JavaScript. As they progress, they can transition from visual blocks to writing code directly, gaining hands-on experience with a real programming language.
3.        Creativity and Problem-Solving: With Applab, kids can create their web apps and games. This creative aspect encourages problem-solving skills as they figure out how to design and implement their ideas.
4.        Immediate-Feedback: Applab provides immediate feedback, allowing students to see the results of their code immediately. This quick feedback loop is essential for learning programming concepts effectively.
5.        Real-World Relevance: Applab introduces students to web development concepts, which are highly relevant in today’s technology-driven world. Understanding web development can spark an interest in further exploring coding and programming as a potential career path.
6.        Project-Based Learning: Code.org’s curriculum, including Applab is designed around project-based learning. Students work on projects and apply their knowledge to solve real-world challenges, making the learning experience more engaging and meaningful.
Overall, Applab from Code.org is a valuable tool for introducing kids to programming and JavaScript in a fun and interactive way. It helps develop their computational thinking, problem-solving abilities, and provide a foundation for further exploration in the field of computer science. Code.org also provide support for teachers to sync their Code.org classrooms with Google classroom. This integration allows teachers to easily manage their students and assignments. This helps teachers keep track of student’s performance and give them valuable feedback in the real time.
