## Title

Karnaugh Mapping and Circuit Design

## Abstract

This session will start with an introduction to an online logic gate simulator, and then focus on using Karnaugh Maps to reduce the number of logic gates needed for a desired circuit outcome. Participants will have a chance to practice developing circuits during the session.
A working knowledge of the basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR) will be helpful but we can also cover these at the beginning of the session.
