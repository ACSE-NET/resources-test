## Title

Beginning with Sensors for Arduino

## Abstract

  The following materials may be used as a review for TEJ3MI or as an introduction to Sensors for the Grade 10 course.  You will find a written-up lab on the Distance Sensor that I give the students as an example of what Iâ€™m expecting from them on the sensor they have been given or have chosen. No duplicate sensors are allowed and each student will give a brief presentation of their sensor and how it works to the class.  I accept the lab writeup afterward. 
Assumptions:
a) basic programming ability already 
b) basic knowledge of breadboarding
c) basic Arduino Microcontroller hookup and program download. 
d) familiarity with Serial Monitor functions 

In class, I have the distance sensor hooked up and running and we play with distances, flick a scarf/arm etc. near it and watch as the distance changes on the serial monitor, we also take a metre stick and see just how accurate it is. We also check the sensitivity range moving to the right and left of centre.

The students then proceed with the research first on their own sensor.
