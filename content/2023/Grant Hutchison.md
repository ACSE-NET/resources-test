## Title

Ontario's New Grade 10 Curriculum Info Session

## Abstract

In this session we will explore the new and revised elements of the Grade 10 Introductory course for the Computer Studies program - ICD2O Digital Technology an Innovations in the Changing World. Some of the major new elements of the course include: artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and computational thinking. During the session we will explore the new course structure and discuss possible instructional strategies to consider including: live coding, peer instruction, pair programming, worked examples, and Universal Design for Learning (UDL). The attendees will have an opportunity to discuss the course revisions following the presentation in small groups. The groups will then have an opportunity to share with the larger group and develop a shared document of possible resources and activities that are aligned with the new course expectations.
