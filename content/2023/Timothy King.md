## Title

Privacy and Security

## Abstract

ICTC has partnered with Field Effect, an Ottawa based cybersecurity company, to offer access to their cloud based training platform called Cyber Range. Using virtual machines and networks in the cloud, we will explore cybersecurity concepts safely and demystify this often anxiety inducing subject. On Cyber Range we will examine hacks in real time and practice operating system and network security tactics. Cyber Range is also where the CyberTitan national student cybersecurity competition takes place, so we’ll also explore what this live capture the flag event looks like. To wrap up this 2.5-hour exploration, Zehra Hasnain from EC Council will end by presenting the many supporting programs they offer (all federally funded through ICTC and free for teachers).
