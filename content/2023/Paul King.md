## Title

Make your own Random Number Generator

## Abstract

This can be aimed at students of ICD2O or ICS3U/C as an interesting way of making a random number generator which produces pseudo-random number between 0 and 1, as determined by a seed value. This is intended as part of a lesson on loops and also practices the student's ability to put an algorithm written in words to one written in code. This can be done in any language, as well as my chosen language of Java. The original algorithm was taken from a now out-of-print text called "Oh! Pascal!" (2nd edition) by Doug Cooper and Michael Clancy (1985, WW Norton).
This material is offered as a lesson for grade 10/beginning grade 11 students to apply an algorithm to code.
