## Title

Code Train: A Resource for Students and Teachers

## Abstract

Computer Science education should promote creativity, encourage resilience and be fun to teach!  With these core principles woven throughout, CodeTrain's completely free teaching resource package is designed for teachers new to Computer Science or those interested in expanding their programs.  Focusing mostly on Javascript and the P5.js library, the package contains daily lesson plans, fully coded examples, student activities, assignments and exemplars. It is designed to be flexible enough to fulfill most provincial curricula and is recognized by the College Board for those interested in Advanced Placement CS Principles.  In this session you will be toured through the resource package and take part in some model lessons, having fun with P5.js along the way.
