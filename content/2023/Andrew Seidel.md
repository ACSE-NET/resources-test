## Title

ICS4U Visual Recursion Project

## Abstract

With the proliferation of large-language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, students are able to use the tools to create programs in any language of their choice by asking the LLM for an answer. In response to this, to ensure students understand how the algorithms work, I've come up with a more visual alternative that ensures students break down the concepts and understand how the recursion works. I have found that this project reflects an accurate measurement of understanding that the students have of how recursive algorithms work.
