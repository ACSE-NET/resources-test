## Title

Using Tinkercad Effectively in Your Courses

## Abstract

This session will teach you how to set up a classroom in TinkerCad for your students.(Why I do it and the benefit of doing this) I will then show you how to use the electronics circuit builder in Tinkercad to build simple circuits. (Light up an LED, use a potentiometer, etc..) If time and interest permits, we can expand into using Tinkercad to build Arduino and other Micro processing circuits, or even TTL logic circuits.
