## Title

Cypher Collection - Group Project

## Abstract

Coding Challenge 1: Cypher

A Gr 12U/C ICS task that gives students the opportunity to work as a whole group by using the branching feature in GitHub.

Language: Java
IDE: Eclipse
Version Control: GitHub

Pull requests are completed online directly with GitHub. By setting up each encode and decode method as public, students can then use the cyphers of their choosing for future projects. Students choose the cypher (and hence the difficulty level so it is appropriate for 12C students as well). Included is the starter code for the project, instructions for students, a link to a slideshow with information on the processes using Github and a link to a document explaining the roles/responsibilities when working in groups and sample templates of a SCRUM chart and Testing Template.
