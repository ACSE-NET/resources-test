## Title

ChatGPT: How It Works and How to Build on It

## Abstract

In the first part of this session, we will develop a complete (non-technical) understanding of how ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) are built and trained. We will get hands-on and use the OpenAI playground to compare various versions of GPT in different states of training. In the second part of the session, we will use OpenAI’s Python interface to try out various prompt engineering techniques for building customized automated assistants and apps with natural language user interfaces. Technologies we will use: a web browser, the latest version of Python, the OpenAI package for Python (“pip install openai”), and any Python IDE
