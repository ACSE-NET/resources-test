## Title

Python Formatting Autograder

## Abstract

This resource provides a versatile tool for both students and educators to validate Python programs against PEP 8 standards. Python's inherent flexibility in formatting code, while a strength, can lead to inconsistent coding styles among students. Encouraging adherence to a single convention—specifically, the PEP 8 formatting standards—enhances the readability of code and sets clear expectations for grading. The tool consists of a Python program that lints code using flake8 and several extensions configured to enforce PEP 8 standards. It processes Python files placed in the designated 'assignments' folder, providing detailed feedback on potential formatting issues and generating statistics. The feedback is written to individual text files, ready to be reviewed.
For students, this program serves as a self-assessment tool. They can lint their code by placing their Python file in the 'assignments' folder and running the program. The resulting text file provides them with detailed feedback, allowing them to understand and rectify any PEP 8 compliance issues.

For educators, the tool aids in the grading process. Teachers can download all the assignment submissions from Brightspace, place them in the 'assignments' folder, and run the program. The program will then generate separate feedback for each student, making it easy to provide precise and helpful feedback on code quality.
