## Title

The Internet Is Not Magic

## Abstract

This is a fun assignment for ICS2O/ICD2O. It's an independent project where students imagine how they would explain what the Internet is and how it works to a time traveller who just travelled to the future. Students create a short slideshow that answers basic questions using explanations that are friendly to someone who has zero prior knowledge of the Internet. I've given this task to Grade 10 students over the past few years and have received some very interesting student submissions. I find that this is a great task for students to demonstrate their understanding of how the Internet actually works and it allows them to have a deeper appreciation of the modern technology they use in their everyday lives.
