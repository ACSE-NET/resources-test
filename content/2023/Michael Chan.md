## Title

Coding: Programming vs. Interfacing

## Abstract

Most CS teachers prefer to work with pure programming in their classes.  I could understand, for some teachers, using electronic interfaces and devices seems to be moving them out of their comfort zones. Circuits troubleshooting and never-ending inventory could be nightmares. Currently, from the Ministry down to school departments, STEM education and coding are for almost all disciplines.  It becomes necessary that teachers apply coding into the physical world, like it or not. I would highly recommend Phidgets to be the solution of making this work. Using the least amount of electronic devices and minimum wiring, we could use the Phidget system to connect coding to the physical environment. I shall demonstrate how easy and fun it is to do programming in arts, science, music, gaming and technology. VR, action game, magic and lockcracking. All the Phidget resources are readily available online making remote classrooms possible and easy. Common programming languages such as Scratch, Javascript, Java or Python could be used. I shall provide starter kits and exemplary projects for teacher groups to explore hands-on in the workshop
