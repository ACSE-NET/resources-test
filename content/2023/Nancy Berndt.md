## Title

Algorithms Presentation

## Abstract

Students are given some python code to start programming algorithms and the timing system to use in their research. Students sign up to research and present a certain search, sort or compression algorithm.Students are given up to two weeks to complete their research and presentations. They then present their algorithm to the class, explaining how the algorithm works, the big O notation, etc. There's a chart for students to summarize the presented algorithms in their notes.
