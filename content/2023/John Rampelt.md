## Title

Optimize Your Curriculum and Use Single-Point Rubrics

## Abstract

Description: Imagine an assessment rubric that is tied to the curriculum expectations, is simple and quick to create, lets students know exactly what they need to accomplish in order to achieve the expected standard, and makes assessment easy. Image no more, the single-point rubric can do all that! In this session you will learn how to streamline your assessment and develop effective single-point rubrics. In addition, we will explore how to develop your curriculum and assessments based on the overall curriculum expectations (rather than trying to match your assessments to them later), determine the ideal weighting of your course content, and create student projects that target your assessment categories.
