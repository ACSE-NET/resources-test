## Title

Incorporating Indigenous Ways of Knowing in Computer Science

## Abstract

The SNP STEAM Academy is an Indigenous (Hodinoso:ni) secondary school in Brantford, Ontario operated by Six Nations Polytechnic. From its inception 7 years ago, the SNP STEAM Academy has partnered with Mohawk College in Hamilton to offer students an early college education pathway, allowing them to earn credit towards a Software Engineering Technician diploma while they are still in high school. In this presentation, we will describe our recent development of course materials to Indigenize the introductory college course for grade 10 Hodinoso:ni and non-Hodinoso:ni students. This is a college credit in HTML & CSS, to be delivered in conjunction with the new ICD2O course
