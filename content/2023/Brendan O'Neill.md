## Title

Combo Lock - code/electric/design/build

## Abstract

This is a simple TEJ2O1 project that can also be used in TEJ3M1.  It shows the starting understandings of turn an LED on/off.
Emphasizes WorkFlow - UML understanding in students solution being provided.  Ideally done with an Arduino, 8 LEDs, 
1 - 220Ohm resistor, a breadboard, wire, and some carboard to make a pretty looking combo lock cube surface.  
It shows the building aspect of the course with minimal efforts and allows for simple soldering.
