## Title

Data Science and Computational Thinking Resources

## Abstract

This workshop will explore free Creative Commons-licensed resources for learning and teaching data science and computational thinking. Participants will complete coding and data science challenges in a friendly competition that is a shortened version of a student hackathon. Through this experience, participants will not only acquire new knowledge and technical expertise, but also gain access to readily available data science resources that can be implemented in their classrooms and schools.
