## Title

Java Exercises

## Abstract

These three sets of exercises correspond to the first three modules with my intermediate Computing Science course: Object Oriented Programming 1, Second Langue Programming 1, and Data Structures. This course is based on the Alberta Education program of studies for Computing Science. They are an introduction to the Java programming language with an early emphasis on object-oriented approaches. The course does assume student proficiency in conditional logic and iteration structures, which in my program are covered in a previous course. The second set of exercises reviews this material in Java. Each folder represents an Eclipse project, which is our IDE of choice. However, one should be able to import the projects to other IDEs with minimal effort.

My core approach for developing student proficiency is to use unit test driven development. A basic problem is posed, and multiple use cases for input and expected output are provided, both for simple cases and for unusual (‘edge’) cases. Students then iteratively develop a solution using the unit test mechanism. This allows students to appreciate the Input-Process-Output paradigm, learn how to debug code, and appreciate the need for sound and complete solutions. Unit test driven development is quite common in industry and translates well to pedagogy.  As a teacher, it also allows me to shift the work of assessment to the student. Only once 100% of unit tests pass do students submit work for review, which allows me to focus more on elegance of approach and adherence to coding standards. My role thus becomes much more about assisting students in their own learning.

The process is very similar to (and inspired by!) how students would use the autograder tool in the CEMC’s Canadian Computing Competition, but with the difference being that students see the unit test cases up front. This allows the unit tests to act as documentation for the problem. I use the standard JUnit library, which is part of the standard Java Development Kit (JDK). However, most of the problems can be translated to other languages such as Python, which have their own standard unit testing libraries. Fundamentally, unit test cases are language agnostic and backward compatible.
