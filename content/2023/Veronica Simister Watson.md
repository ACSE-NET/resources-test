## Title

Dream Job

## Abstract

The "Dream Job" is a personal research assignment that can be used at the beginning of the semester as part of the community-building activities while satisfying some curriculum requirements for Introduction to Computer Science (ICS3U). It gives students time to think about a future career and chart the course to get there. For this class, it is typical that more than eighty percent of the careers chosen are computer science related and so everyone learns about various computer science careers and the necessary postsecondary pathways. Those who select careers outside of computer science explore how computer science intersects with what they have chosen. Students also share their talents, passions, and interests, and then they indicate how these played a role in steering them to their career choice. 

Once the assignment is completed, students can create a poster, vision board, or other visual that can be displayed in a space where it will be seen daily as a reminder of their goals. The specific careers, talents, and interests shared can be referenced throughout the semester for personalized interactions with students.
