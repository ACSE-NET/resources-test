## Title

Recreate a Retro Computer Game

## Abstract

This project outline will have students demonstrate their understanding of computer programming concepts through the recreation of a classic retro-computer/video game.

Oftentimes in beginning programming, we often look towards exemplars that are wonderfully complex. However, this is one way in which the beginning programmer can become quickly overwhelmed. While in the end, we aim to be able to create, for example, 3d-first-person perspective multiplayer games, it is easy to get frustrated with the process because the underlying elements are overlooked. These basic elements might be simply things like variables and data structures.

The links that you will find in this project are carefully chosen to show you how we can create useful or entertaining programs with smaller steps on your programming journey.

· An important step in your Final Project for this course is the research of historical video / computer games.

· This research is where you are expected to find a game to recreate in the Python computer language.
