## Title

GitHub Tools

## Abstract

This presentation will present to other teachers a short "course" called learning git with GitHub. The course will be delivered using GitHub teacher tools such as GitHub classroom, code spaces and GitHub actions. It will give teachers a chance to experience how GitHub works as a student then show what it takes to set up the course from a teacher's perspective. New tools such as Code Spaces and GitHub actions will also be presented.
