## Title

Beginner lesson using Processing

## Abstract

Hatch Canada is an online learning platform for children 7-17. We deliver programs in schools across the GTA, Ottawa and Boston, with the goal being self-paced mastery learning using JavaScript and Python programming. This is the lesson plan that all our school-based programs start with on the first day and the project that every Hatch student completes first.
