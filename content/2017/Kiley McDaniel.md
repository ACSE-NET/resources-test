## Title

Install and test a webserver

## Abstract

As an extension to the networking unit in TEJ3E4E you could invite students to install and test a webserver (IIS) on Windows 10.   It would be good to install a LAMP or XAMPP (php/mysql/phpmyadmin) .  It can be used as a tool for teaching web design, databases (structure, fields, records) and SQL (ex.  Select * from spyfile2).	Lastly,  it can be used by Python and Java programming students in ICS to connect to data and apply/compare algorithms.
