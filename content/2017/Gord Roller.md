## Title

TEJ3M Programming/Interfacing Culminating Task

## Abstract

Resource for grade 11 (or 12) Computer Engineering.  It is a culminating task designed for the interfacing unit, but could certainly be used as a summative for the grade 11 course as it involves computer components, electronics, programming and interfacing.  Both the PowerPoint source file as well as a .pdf version are included.
