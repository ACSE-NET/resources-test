## Title

ICS3M Problem Set - Introductory Python Exercises

## Abstract

This is a problem set that should be used after basics of the Python programing language have been introduced in class. The Python knowledge required to complete this problem set are knowledge of Python variables, data types, mathematical operations, if statements, for loops and the Turtle module. This problem set could be simplified to not include if statements, loops or turtle by getting rid of Part 5 from the instructions. Without Part 5, very basic coding knowledge is tested (variables, data types, mathematical operations), making this a good introductory problem set or warm-up exercise for students to get used to programming.
