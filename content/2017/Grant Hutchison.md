## Title

CS Principles? Broadening Participation in Computer Science

## Abstract

The Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP http://www.apcsp.org) course represents a CS curriculum designed to maximize student engagement in the use of computation for problem solving and creative expression. The course is designed around 7 "Big Ideas" of Computer Science and 6 Computational Thinking practices. The 7 Big Ideas include: Programming, Abstractions, Algorithms, Data and Information, The Internet, Global Impact, and Creativity. Unlike the AP CS A course, any programming language can be used and many organizations are offering excellent materials to support student learning.
In this workshop we will explore how the course was implemented at our school using a combination of Python and App Inventor. The course was offered as a blended offering within the ICS3U - Grade 11 Computer Science course. Workshop participants will try sample exam questions and create mini student projects including Create and Explorer Performance Tasks. Note: Many of the classroom resources shared in this session are applicable to any CS teacher (even if you have no plans of introducing AP CS Principles to your school)
