## Title

Introduction to the Hummingbird Robotics Kit

## Abstract

The Hummingbird Robotics Kit is a spin-off product of Carnegie Mellon's CREATE lab and is designed to enable engineering and robotics activities for ages 13 and up, that involve the making of robots, kinetic sculptures, and animatronics built out of a combination of kit parts and crafting materials. Combined with very easy-to-use software environments like Scratch, Snap!, the CREATE Lab Visual Programmer, and Ardublock, Hummingbird provides a great way to introduce kids to robotics and engineering with construction materials that they are already familiar with. At the same time, Hummingbird continues to provide new challenges by allowing programming in the Arduino environment, Python, Java, and Processing, and by supporting Raspberry Pi. Participants will design, craft and program a spectacular interactive sign using Scratch. Art supplies, Kit components & Laptops will be provided for this session. Note: Other working models will be available to view to show the possibilities, as well as program if interested. Participants will be allowed to take their creative model, but the Hummingbird Duo Controller, & Laptops will need to be returned at the end of the session.
