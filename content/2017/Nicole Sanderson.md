## Title

The Foundations for Academic Success Project

## Abstract

The Foundations for Academic Success project aspires to improve student engagement with academic material by exploring mobile learning to better resonate with the current student population. Our objectives are to develop strategies for enhancing student academic integrity (AI) knowledge and understanding by employing an open access mobile technology application with an innovative pedagogical approach. This research project will support the development, administration, and assessment of the Foundations for Academic Success academic integrity mobile learning (FAS) app (See the prototype app by clicking on this link:http://a-i-s.epizy.com/?i=1 ) that explores the best strategies, from a student user perspective, for accessing, delivering, assessing, and learning this information with mobile technology (m-learning). Moreover,the academic integrity content in this mobile application will extend beyond its utility to University of Waterloo students as the values of academic integrity it promotes apply provincially, nationally and internationally.
