## Title

ICS3U/4U with C#

## Abstract

Python is often taught because it is "easy to learn". Are we doing a disservice to our students by picking a language because it is easy? Find out how easy C# can be to teach and how robust it is: GUIs, mobile, web, consoles and game. This session will include hands on activities and self-directed activities that cater to a variety of skill levels. Complete course progressions for ICS3U/4U will be shared. If participants have a Windows machine with them they may want to install Visual Studio Community Edition 2015
