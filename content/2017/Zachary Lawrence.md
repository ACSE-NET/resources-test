## Abstract

This resource is two assignments that are completed simultaneously by students taking the Grade 12 ICS4U course. Students are
arranged into groups, and over the course of a few weeks take turns leading a group coding project and being a member of one. Group

and completing a Software Scope Document that they will use to organize and delegate tasks out to team members
