## Title

Topics in Computer Science Presentation

## Abstract

This is a research and presentation project designed to cover Overall Expectation D2 of the ICS3U curriculum (or D3 in the ICS4U curriculum).  The project has students perform independent research into an emerging area of computer science, and discuss how this topic is important to the advancement of computer science, as well as other areas of study (business, science, mathematics, etc.).  Students are given some freedom in how they present their findings, in order to allow them to highlight their own areas of interest, as well as means with which the teacher can differentiate the project (i.e. an ESL student could create a video where they can keep redoing the narration until they get it “just right”).  The project handout/description, as well as the marking rubric, are all included in the same file.
