## Title

Arduino shield for RTC

## Abstract

This project was the culminating or rich performance task for Grade 11
students (TEJ or TEL). Aim of the project is to make an RTC (Real Time
Clock) shield for Arduino UNO. The shield will display time in HH:MM
format on a multiplexed LED display. Students can add more features to
the project e.g. showing date and month and alarm. Students designed
the Arduino UNO shield using Eagle software. The shield houses a
4-digit multiplexed LED display and a DS3231 RTC module to Arduino.
Project description, datasheet for the display, Arduino libraries,
Eagle files and an example Sketch are included. I have included image
of the shield that teachers can use to make their own circuit board
without using Eagle. Please email me: raj.nachimuthu@gmail.com if you
need more information.
