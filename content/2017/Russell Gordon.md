## Title

Using Lindemayer Systems to Introduce CS Concepts

## Abstract

Hollywood movies are increasingly saturated with computer-generated images, or CGI. Pixar has become a household name. How, though, is such realistic imagery produced? In 1968, Aristid Lindenmayer, a botanist, developed a system for modelling the growth of plants. In this session, you will learn the basics of 'L-systems' and how they can be used to teach the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and make some really cool animations, including forest-like scenes. Although practical code for this session is written in Swift, no prior experience with the language is required, and L-system concepts are languageagnostic. You can absolutely take the concept and run with the provided materials in your own classes, no matter what software or hardware platform you are using. All the software you need today will be waiting for you in the lab; no equipment is required on your part.
