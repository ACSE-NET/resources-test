## Title

Culminating Task - Processing Gr.11

## Abstract

This is the Final Project used in ICS3U.  The students worked in groups and each student had a different responsibility; project manager, tester, programmerÖ
Each group created a different type of game, and students were organized by the type of game they wanted to work on.  The final games were a board game, simulation, racing game, and maze game.  The class shared a scoring routine, which could be modified as required.
A great deal of scaffolding was done with the class regarding game projects using ghant charts etc.  They are attached too.
Iíve attached the initial handout, additional help sheets all in one document.  It was initially split up.
From the students you have; flowcharts, ghant charts, and some pseudo code or checklists or IPO charts and some logs.  Students did have options for reporting.  Some groups did deviate from their initial proposed work plan.
The four examples are the exact projects as handed in.  As you can see they range in abilities and skill levels.  The students were to indicate borrowed code inline in their comments, some did not.
Also, two groups created app versions of their games as well.  I have one for iPad and another for Android.  We also played with the a bit.
Enjoy!
