## Title

Lists of Objects in Greenfoot

## Abstract

This is an assignment to be completed using the java environment called Greenfoot.  It is appropriate for ICS 4U1 since it makes use of a list of objects. Assignment Create a Greenfoot world where 3 different colors of balloons (red, blue, yellow) are appearing in random locations.  The keyboard will be used to remove balloons of a particular color. Pressing the ìrî key will remove all red balloons (as long as it is pressed). Pressing the ìbî key will remove all blue balloons. Pressing the ìyî key will remove all yellow balloons. Starter code To help students with the assignment you may wish to give them a simplified version to start with.  A starter version called GColors_start is included in this folder.   Given this code, the assignment is to add code so that each balloon is randomly colored red or blue or yellow.  Pressing the corresponding key will remove all balloons of that color (as long as it is pressed). I have also included the solution code, saved as BColors_KEY.
