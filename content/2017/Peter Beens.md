## Title

Peter Beens' Resources (everything!)

## Abstract

Instead of sharing a single resource, I’m sharing everything I have!
I have resources available for both Computer Technology and Computer Studies.
My old website (on Google Sites) is www2.beens.org. You’ll see tabs across the top for each subject.
My new website (on Wordpress) is www.beens.org. You’ll see a menu across the top for each subject, but it’s not yet as organized as my old site (it’s a work in progress!).
I’m also starting to put resources on GitHub, so you’re welcome to nab anything you like from there as well. The URL is github.com/pbeens.
