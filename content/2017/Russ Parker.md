## Title

Intro to Sorting Techniques

## Abstract

The following four handouts could be used in ICS3U or ICS4U as an introduction to sorting techniques.  One complete example of the logical steps required in using a Linear Insertion, Bubble Exchange and Straight Selection technique is provided.  Once the students have completed programming these algorithms the next step would be to compare their "efficiency" using a Timer function on an integer and decimal array of a thousand numbers
