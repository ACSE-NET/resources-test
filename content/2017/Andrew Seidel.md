## Title

Marking Less in ICS

## Abstract

In our board (Peel District School Board), there has been a focus on Overarching Learning Goals (OLGs), as well as a focus on Learning Goals and Success Criteria (as in Growing Success). In this interactive session, I will go over what these are, and how this has lowered my marking load while bringing in more descriptive feedback. As such, I have been able to complete more assessment for, and of learning, while also increasing my evaluation ability based on observations and conversations. After going through the factors that helped to make this happen, the session will continue on with a collaborative effort to create a personal plan to decrease your marking load, while increasing your focus on the core ideas of the course. Share what has worked for you in the past, and come learn from each other.
