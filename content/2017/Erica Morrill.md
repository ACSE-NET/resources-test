## Title

Introduction to the micro:bit

## Abstract

This session is an introduction to the pocket-sized microprocessor from the UK called the micro:bit. The micro:bit has LEDs, a compass, accelerometer, sensors, buttons and pins which allow students to become digital creators. External sensors can be added to the micro:bit to extend it functionality. Coding the micro:bit is easy with a variety of online editors such as Microsoft Block Editor and Python. A variety of resources and communities are available on the Internet to help teachers implement the micro:bit into their curriculum. In this session, participants will have the opportunity to explore the features and applications of the micro:bit in education. The micro:bit can be programmed using an online editor, however participants may wish to download the free micro:bit app (iOS or Android) to have mobile access to programming the micro:bit
