## Title

JavaScript is Everywhere

## Abstract

JavaScript is a language that is cross platform and available on pretty much on any system. It is the language that drives the modern web. It is used by institutions like Stanford as the introduction language. Teaching it in the classroom requires nothing more than a simple text editor and a web browser. It has capabilities to create graphics (even hardware accelerated 3D graphics), interact with video/audio, and has OO capabilities. This talk will introduce you to the basics of JavaScript (and its unique quirks) and the tools you can use to teach JavaScript in your classroom. It includes: 
• JavaScript basics 
• Object oriented programming using JavaScript 
• Various tools (both locally and web based) that will help you teach JavaScript
