## Title

Introduction to Pygame

## Abstract

he files could be used to help introduce pygame with python 3.x. I used with my ICS4U and 4C. It steps them through the process of creating objects on the screen and manipulating with keyboard strokes and then interacting with other objects.
Instructions (teacher set and student set) are included.  Student set are the same, except the code is an image, forcing students to write the code out themselves rather than just copying and pasting.  My hope was that this would get the students thinking a little more about the code. I've also included source files as a resource.
If you have questions, I can be contacted at holmjohn@alcdsb.on.ca
