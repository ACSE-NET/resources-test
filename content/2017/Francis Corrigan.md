## Title

Assessing Multi-dimensional Arrays in Any Programming Langua

## Abstract

This resource provides a method of assessing a student’s understanding of a multi-dimensional array by having the student write code that requires the stepping through a multidimensional array in different patterns while producing simple mathematical calculations such as multiple sums and averages.  The method is language independent, requires that the teacher be able to execute the student’s program or have a printout of the program output. Assessment is simplified because the correct answers are brief and precise. This resource is especially suitable for test and exam questions.
