## Title

Online Classrooms: Moodle vs. Google

## Abstract

During the last summer conference, many teachers expressed interests in Moodle. On the other hand, Google classrooms are picking force as a result of boardwide endorsement. I have used both platforms for my classes and would like to share my experience in this workshop. In addition to information and facilities about these two classroom management tools, I would like to compare the pros and cons between these two systems. I am confident that this presentation would not only help teachers to get to know how to use online classroom packages, but also have enough info to decide for themselves which to use. At the end of the presentation, attending teachers should have a skeleton online classroom ready for the coming semester.
