## Title

Hacking the Internet of Things: Digitizing the Physical Worl

## Abstract

This workshop will explore the use of simple data acquisition methods (USB based analogue / digital I/O devices, Arduinos, hacked joysticks and other techniques) to provide low cost ways to interface sensors with a PC in order to support digitization of the physical world. Examples will include temperature, weight, and light sensors along with software techniques that tie math (calibration and linearization of analogue sensors) and physics to allow students to measure and learn about the world around them. This forms the basis of our Internet of Things â€“ ubiquitous sensor technologies that silently collect data for processing the world over
